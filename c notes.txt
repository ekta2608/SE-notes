Language:
=======
The way to communicate b/w two person ,they can use any language of their understanding


Programming Language:
========================

The way of coomunication b/w man and machine is called programming language.

C Basic:
--------------

Introduction to C: 1972 by dennis ritchie at bell laboatory (AT & T lab in USA)

Application:
=============

used for OS,compiler design,developing system s/w,
application software.(ATM, business appl,scentific appl, school management system).


Features:
=================

1.Easy
2.portable.
3.case-senstive.             A - a diffenent for machine
4.structure language.
5.middle level language.        (pop-- oop)
6.32 keyword.
7.extension used in C is .c
8)General purpose programming language
9)Powerful/Robust programming language


complier:
============

its read the whole at one time then execute its result.

like we say if we store on movie in our system which is of different language and
when ever i used to run that movie ,its sublitile hepl me to execute the process. so we can say it store is object code in our system



interperter:
=========

it read the program line by line.

like we say,if we went to another country when language is differ, then we hired on meditor so that
he/she can transalte the language and explain me same vice verse to that particular people also.so we can say
its dont not save any object code,it will only execute we it call.

C -  32 Keyword:
========================

int  float  char  void  if   else
double  static  signed  unsigned  sizeof
const  struct  union  typedef  switch  case
while  return  auto  enum  short  default
long  do  continue  break  goto 
extern  volatile.


 
Datatype:Such keywords which are used to declare(create) variables are called keyword.
         i)   The data type decide the type of value that can be store in variable. int a;
         ii)  Size of variable in the memory is also decided by datatype. int a=20; 4byte 20*4=80
         iii) Range of value that can be stored into variable. int 3----wrong, int a=3;  
 l
ex : like subject- if we are studing maths subject then we will only perform maths task

variable- are maths numerical values we can say. that when we are performing maths at that time we will only
deal with numerical values only.

so as datatype and varibale----- when we want to perform interger type value we will apply int datatype and store its value in variable which we will define.

Data types:
------------

  i)Primary datatypes:Such datatypes are already defined in C language are called primary datatype.
                      In C language we have following 4 primary data type.


      data type keyword          type of value     size          Range
   
   a)  int                        integer           2/4byte     -32768 to 32767 /-2147483648 to 2147483647
   b)  float 23.4                 real              4 byte      -3.4*10^-38 to 3.4*10^38
   c)  double  2345.6789          real              8 byte      -1.7*10^308 to 1.7*10^308
   d)  char   'a''-'              single character  1 byte      -128 to 127


  ii)Secondary datatypes:(user defined data type): 
                         discuss later

 
Variable:variable is a name given to the memory location. 
         A variable is used to store value. The value stored in the 
         variable can be changed(vary). while creating variable we must 
         follow the rules, which are created for identifiers.


Variable are three types:
i)   Global variable.
ii)  local variable.
iii) Static variable.



Output statement: A statement that is used to print values or information from
                  program to the output screen or a file, is called output
                  statement. In C language we use prinf() to print any value
                  on output screen(monitor). printf() is formatted output function.
                  It means it requires a format string to print anything. it can print value of any data type.

Syntax of printf():
-----------------
  i) To print message:
      
     printf("message");

  ii)To print value:
      
      printf("formatString", variable);
   
       format String:start with % sign,and it specifies
        the format of the value that is to be printed.

           datatype             formatString

            int                      %d or %i
            float                    %f      format specificer
            double                   %lf
            char                     %c

e.g  i)  int a=10;

       printf("%d",a); 
       The above statement will print 10.

     ii) int salary=30000;
       required o/p:My salary is 30000
       Statement to be used:  printf("My salary is %d",salary);

     iii) int x=10,y=20,z=x+y;
          required o/p:
          sum of 10 and 20 is 30

          printf("sum of x: %d and  y:%d is z:%d",x,y,z);

   iv) float x=123.45
       printf("value of x is %f",x);
   
       output: value of x is 123.450000

Input statement:A statement that is used to read value and store that value unto a variable
                such statement is called input statement.scanf() function is used to read from keyword at program runtime.
                scanf() is console,formatted,input function.

                console:read value keyword
                formatted:uses format string

     note: scanf() is also decalred in the stdio.h header file.

 syntax:

       scanf("formatString",&varname);
        int x;
        scanf("%d",&x);
 
        int x,y;
        scanf("%d",&x);
        scanf("%d",&y);
         OR

        scanf("%d %d",&x,&y);


BASIC STRUCTURE OF C LANGUAGE:
------------------------------------
 1)preprocessor/preprocessive directive:
    Such instruction or command which perform their task before compilation
    of program are called preproessor.

    All the preprocessor directives are started with hash symbols( #)
    
    e.g: #include

         whenever we use printf() and scanf() in our program then we include stdio.h file.
       
        syntax: #include<stdio.h>
 
 2)comments
           Comments are used for documentation purpose. comments are ignored by compiler.
           In C language we use following 2 type comments.
           i) single line comments
              //
           ii)multiline comments
              /*  
                .....    
              */

 3)user defined functions: Function defined by user are called user defined function.

 4)global variable:A global variable can be used in our program is called global variable.
                    A variable which is declared outside main() is a global variable.
 5) void main()
   {

   }

     OR

   int main()

   {
     return 0;
   }
   
  main() is a function. its name is predefined and its coding is user defined.

  main() is the entry point for the execution of C program.
  
  Program can have only one main()

  If a c program does not have main function,then the program can be compiled but
  cannot be executed.
